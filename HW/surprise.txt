1. What are 3-5 (or more) commands that you can use on terminal and what do they do? What language is your computer terminal in?

The cd is to change the directory, ls is to list all the directories or files, open is to simply open a file, cp is to copy a file from a directory to another, and move is to move the file to a different directory.
- The language my computer is in is GitBash
